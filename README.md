## Scope of the project

I tried to make a binary classification Neural Network model to classify wether a patient will develop type II diabetes based on multiple variables, such as eating habits, existing health concerns, family history, lifestyle and body parameters.
The results and the exact performance of the model can be seen in the JupyterNotebook file. The source of the information is a study conducted by the CDC mainly via telephone in 2015.
